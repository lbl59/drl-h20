Basic resources exploring Reinforcement Learning and reservoir operations.

THe ``ppo_intro/`` folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with an intro to Proximal Policy Optimization, related to Lillian Lau's post on the Water Programming Blog: [Deep Reinforcement Learning with PPO (the ML kind, not the health insurance kind)](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2023/04/12/ppo-the-ml-kind-not-the-health-insurance-kind/)

The ``resops/`` folder contains code implementing custom OpenAI Gym environments for reservoir operations with both continuous and discrete state/action spaces, along with a script for running a basic simulation using this environment. This code relates to Andrew Hamilton's post on the Water Programming Blog: [Optimizing reservoir operations with Reinforcement Learning, Pt 1: Creating a custom Gymnasium environment](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2023/04/27/optimizing-reservoir-operations-with-reinforcement-learning-pt-1-creating-a-custom-gymnasium-environment/).
